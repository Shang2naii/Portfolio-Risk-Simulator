3. **Visualize Data**: Explore the correlation matrix and performance charts to gain insights into your investments.
4. **Compare Performance**: Use the benchmark comparison feature to see how your portfolio stacks up against industry standards.

## Key Concepts

### Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR is a statistical technique used to measure the risk of loss on an investment. It estimates how much a set of investments might lose, given normal market conditions, in a set time period.

### Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return. It helps investors understand how much extra return they receive for the additional volatility they endure for holding a riskier asset.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

This technique uses randomness to simulate a wide range of possible outcomes for your portfolio. It provides a comprehensive view of potential risks and rewards.
